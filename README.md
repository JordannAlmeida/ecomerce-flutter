# my_ecommerce_jordann

This project is a sample of a Flutter aplication. This is my first app using Flutter.

This app has an integration module attached to firebase, in addition to the data being also managed in firebase. In this application it is possible to add several products to the shopping cart and go to the checkout screen, which has the value calculations as well as the discount to be applied according to the coupon used.
